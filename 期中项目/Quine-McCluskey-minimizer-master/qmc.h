/**
 * Simplify a truth table.
 *
 * @param num is the number of literals (input) in your truth table.
 *
 * @param table is the truth table you specified. It is a boolean array, with
 * each bit of the index specifying the input. e.g. for a truth table which has
 * 2 literals, table[0] and table[3] indicate the output when both of them are
 * false and true respectively, while table[1] and table[2] indicates the
 * output when one of them is true and the other is false.
 *
 * @param out is the output simplified boolean expression. *out has a the
 * number of elements of @num * @out_size, which means *out contains @out_size
 * groups of @num elements. Each group represents a clause. For each group, the
 * nth element indicates the status of nth literal in the clause -- 0 means
 * false, 1 means true, -1 means this literal is not in this clause. *out must
 * be released by using qmc_free() when it's no longer been used.
 *
 * @param out_size is the output size. If @out_size is 0, it means all
 * entry in the table are true or false. See @out for more details.
 *
 * @return 0 if succeeds, otherwise fails.
