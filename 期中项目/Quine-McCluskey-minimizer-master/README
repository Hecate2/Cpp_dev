This is a Quine-McCluskey minimizer library modified from Stefan Moebius'
command line only version[1]. I didn't change any of the algorithm. I only
changed the input and output, and also added some documents.

Function explanation can be found in qmc.h. To use it, simply include
quine_mc_cluskey.c and qmc.h in your project and compile. An example is
available in example.c.

All files are in public domain, thus no guarantee is provided, but you can use
it freely as you wish no matter for what use.

The original readme written by Stefan is readme.orig.txt.
